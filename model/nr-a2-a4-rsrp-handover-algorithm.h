/**
 * @brief Handover algorithm implementation based on RSRP measurements, Event
 *        A2 and Event A4.
 *
 * Handover decision made by this algorithm is primarily based on Event A2
 * measurements (serving cell's RSRP becomes worse than threshold). When the
 * event is triggered, the first condition of handover is fulfilled.
 *
 * Event A4 measurements (neighbour cell's RSRP becomes better than threshold)
 * are used to detect neighbouring cells and their respective RSRP. When a
 * neighbouring cell's RSRP is higher than the serving cell's RSRP by a certain
 * offset, then the second condition of handover is fulfilled.
 *
 * When the first and second conditions above are fulfilled, the algorithm
 * informs the gNB RRC to trigger a handover.
 *
 * The threshold for Event A2 can be configured in the `ServingCellThreshold`
 * attribute. The offset used in the second condition can also be configured by
 * setting the `NeighbourCellOffset` attribute.
 *
 * The following code snippet is an example of using and configuring the
 * handover algorithm in a simulation program:
 *
 *     Ptr<NrHelper> nrHelper = CreateObject<NrHelper> ();
 *
 *     NodeContainer gnbNodes;
 *     // configure the nodes here...
 *
 *     nrHelper->SetHandoverAlgorithmType ("ns3::NrA2A4RsrpHandoverAlgorithm");
 *     nrHelper->SetHandoverAlgorithmAttribute ("ServingCellThreshold",
 *                                               UintegerValue (30));
 *     nrHelper->SetHandoverAlgorithmAttribute ("NeighbourCellOffset",
 *                                               UintegerValue (1));
 *     NetDeviceContainer nrGnbDevs = nrHelper->InstallGnbDevice (gnbNodes);
 *
 * @note Setting the handover algorithm type and attributes after the call to
 *       NrHelper::InstallGnbDevice does not have any effect to the devices
 *       that have already been installed.
