Introduction
------------
The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has devoted significant efforts to standardize the fifth-generation (5G) New Radio (NR) access technology [TS38300]_, which is designed to be extremely flexible from its physical layer definition and up to the architecture. The objective is to be able to work in a wide range of frequency bands and address many different use cases and deployment options.

As the NR specification is developed and evolves, a network simulator that is capable of simulating emerging NR features is of great interest for both scientific and industrial communities. In recent years a lot of effort has been made by New York University (NYU) Wireless and the University of Padova to develop a simulator that will allow simulations of communications in millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands, the heart of future 5G cellular wireless systems. Hence, a new mmWave simulation tool has been developed as a new module of ns-3. A complete description of the mmWave module is provided in [end-to-end-mezz]_. The mmWave module source code is still not part of the standard ns-3 distribution and is available at a different repository [mmwave-module]_. In the mmWave module, the physical (PHY) layer and medium access control (MAC) are a modified version of the ns-3 'LTE' PHY and MAC layers, supporting a mmWave channel, propagation, beamforming, and antenna models. The MAC layer supports Time Division Duplexing (TDD), and a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) MAC scheduling, with enhanced Hybrid Automatic Repeat and reQuest (HARQ) for low latency applications. The higher layers are mostly based on ns-3 'LTE' module functionalities but are extended to support features such as dual connectivity and low latency radio link control (RLC) layer.

In this document, we describe the implementation that we have initiated to generate a 3GPP-compliant NR module able to provide ns-3 simulation capabilities in the bands above and below 6 GHz, aligned with 3GPP NR Release-15, following the description in [TS38300]_. The work has been initially funded by InterDigital Communications Inc, and continues with funding from the Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) and a grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST).

The 'NR' module is focused on targeting the 3GPP Release-15 NR specification. As such, it incorporates fundamental PHY-MAC NR features like
a flexible frame structure by means of multiple numerologies support, bandwidth parts (BWPs), Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) of numerologies,
Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), flexible time- and frequency- resource allocation and scheduling, Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC)
coding for data channels, modulation and coding schemes (MCSs) with up to 256-QAM, and dynamic TDD, among others.
The NR higher layers and core network (RLC, PDCP, RRC, NAS, EPC) are mainly based on the higher layers implementation
from |ns3| 'LTE' module. The NR module provides an NR non-standalone (NSA) implementation.

The source code for the 'NR' module lives currently in the directory ``src/nr``.

Over time, extensions found in this module may migrate to the existing ns-3 main development tree.

The rest of this document is organized into five major chapters:

2. **Design:**  Describes the models developed for ns-3 extension to support NR features and procedures.

Design
------
In this section, we present the design of the different features and procedures that we have developed following 3GPP Release-15 NR activity. For those features/mechanisms/layers that still have not been upgraded to NR, the current design following LTE specifications is also indicated.

Open issues and future work
---------------------------

Known open issues of the 'NR' module are tracked in the issue tracker of the 'NR' GitLab repository: https://gitlab.com/cttc-lena/nr/-/issues. Please refer to it for the list of currently open issues, and use it to report any new issue you may find.

Regarding future work, the list of supported, partially supported, and planned features of the 'NR' module is maintained in the ``FEATURES.md`` file, located at the root directory of the 'NR' repository and available online at the 5G-LENA website: https://5g-lena.cttc.es/features/. That file provides an at-a-glance view of the status of each feature, organized per layer, together with the calibration and testing framework, and the extensions built on top of the 'NR' module (Sidelink and NR-V2X, O-RAN, and NR-U). It also contains the planned roadmap with the pending and ongoing enhancements.
