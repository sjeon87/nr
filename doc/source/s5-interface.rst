S5 interface
************
The S5 interface connects the Serving Gateway (SGW) to the Packet Data Network Gateway (PGW) inside
the EPC, following the EPS architecture of [TS23401]_. As in LTE, it has both a user plane and a
control plane:

* **S5-U** carries user data between the SGW and the PGW over GTP-U (GTPv1-U, [TS29281]_);
* **S5-C** carries control signalling between the SGW and the PGW over GTP-C (GTPv2-C, [TS29274]_).

The endpoints are ``NrEpcSgwApplication`` (which also terminates S1-U and the S11 interface) and
``NrEpcPgwApplication`` (which also terminates the SGi/Gi interface toward the external network
through a ``VirtualNetDevice``).

User plane (S5-U)
=================
S5-U encapsulates the end-to-end IP packets in GTP-U/UDP/IP (UDP port 2152) using the ``NrGtpuHeader``
(identical to the LTE GTP-U header, with no NR PDU-session extension header). The data path uses a
single TEID end-to-end: the SGW does not translate between an S1-U and an S5-U TEID in the data
plane. As on S1-U, EPS-bearer QoS is **not** enforced on the link.

Downlink classification -- deciding which QoS flow (and therefore which GTP-U tunnel) a packet belongs
to -- is performed at the PGW: ``NrEpcPgwApplication`` runs an ``NrQosRuleClassifier`` in the
downlink direction to obtain a QFI, then maps the QFI to the corresponding TEID via
``m_teidByFlowIdMap``. This replaces the LTE arrangement, where the classifier was keyed directly by
TEID.

Control plane (S5-C)
====================
S5-C uses GTPv2-C [TS29274]_, encoded with ``NrGtpcHeader``. The message set is inherited from LTE
with the bearer vocabulary renamed to QoS flows (the numeric message-type values are unchanged):

* ``CreateSessionRequest`` / ``CreateSessionResponse``;
* ``ModifyFlowRequest`` / ``ModifyFlowResponse`` (the LTE ``ModifyBearer*``);
* ``DeleteFlowRequest`` / ``DeleteFlowCommand`` / ``DeleteFlowResponse`` (the LTE ``DeleteBearer*``).

The flow-context information elements carry the QFI, the ``NrQosFlow`` and the ``NrQosRule``; the
serialized QoS-rule IE additionally carries the rule precedence and its QFI.

TEID assignment is the key mechanic to note here (the broader statement that the S1-U, S5-U SGW and
S5-U PGW TEIDs are mutually independent is made in the :doc:`EPC <epc>` section). The SGW allocates
the per-flow S5-U data TEID from a counter (``++m_teidCount``) and uses the UE's IMSI as the S5-C
control TEID; the **PGW does not allocate new TEIDs** -- it echoes the SGW's S5-U TEID back when
binding the flow. The Create Session exchange that establishes these tunnels is driven over
:doc:`S11 <s11-interface>` during the NAS attach.

:numref:`fig-s5` shows the GTP-C message exchange on S5-C; it mirrors S11 (same ``NrGtpcHeader``
encoding) but runs between the SGW and the PGW.
